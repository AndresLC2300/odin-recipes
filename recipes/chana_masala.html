        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Chana masala is a flavorful Indian curry made with chickpeas cooked in a spiced tomato and onion base, enriched with ginger, garlic,<br>
                and a blend of warming spices like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and garam masala. The dish balances earthy, savory, and tangy notes,<br>
                often brightened with lemon juice or dried mango powder, and is typically enjoyed with rice or Indian breads such as naan, roti, or<br> 
                bhature, making it a hearty and comforting vegetarian favorite.

            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Fry bay leaves in hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
